What is Zcash?
--------------

`Zcash <https://z.cash/>`_ is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol.
Based on Bitcoin's code, it intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy
through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves
confidentiality of transaction metadata. For more technical details, please check out our `Protocol Specification <https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf>`_.
