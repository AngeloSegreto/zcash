# Zcash Full Node and CLI

Zcashd & Zcash-cli allow you to run a full node and interact with it via a command-line interface.  The zcashd full node downloads a copy of the Zcash blockchain,  enforces rules of the Zcash network, and can execute all functionalities. The zcash-cli allows interactions with the node (i.e. tell it to send a transaction).
