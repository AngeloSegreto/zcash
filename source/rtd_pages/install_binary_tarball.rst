Binary Tarball Download & Setup
===============================

The Electric Coin Company provides a binary tarball for download.

`Download Tarball for Debian Stretch v4.0.0 <https://z.cash/downloads/zcash-3.1.0-linux64-debian-stretch.tar.gz>`_

After downloading but before extracting, verify that the checksum of the tarball matches the hash below for the version of the binary you downloaded:

Debian Stretch:

.. code-block:: bash

   sha256sum zcash-4.0.0-linux64-debian-stretch.tar.gz

Result: ``a0daf673d45e92fe97f2dd43bbaf6d6653940643aff62915f46df89af4d8c8b5``

This checksum was generated from our gitian deterministic build process. `View all gitian signatures <https://github.com/zcash/gitian.sigs/tree/master>`_.

Once you've verified that it matches, extract the files and move the binaries into your executables $PATH: 

.. code-block:: bash

    tar -xvf zcash-4.0.0-linux64.tar.gz

    mv -t /usr/local/bin/ zcash-4.0.0/bin/*

Now that Zcash is installed, run this command to download the parameters used to create and verify shielded transactions:

.. code-block:: bash 

    zcash-fetch-params

Finally, set up ``~/.zcash/zcash.conf`` before running Zcash as your local user, as documented in the :ref:`user_guide`.
