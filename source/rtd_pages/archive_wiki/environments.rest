 Environments
==============

We reuse a distinction of `environments` across Zcash in multiple
instances. Ideally these concepts are orthogonally applied to different
`areas` such as the Zcash blockchains/networks, continuous integration,
monitoring infrastructure, our website, etcâ€¦

- **Production** is the live system. It has live users and must be
  updated in a way that does not violate `support requirements`, and in
  a way that's planned, explicit, and well known by the stake-holders,
  such that their use is not interrupted.
- **Staging** is a `release-identical` system as much as possible,
  meaning to change staging environments you go through `the same
  deployment process` as for production. Only production-quality code
  is deployed to staging. Ideally the only differences between staging
  and production is that production is running an older version of the
  same releases and carries the live environment (eg. the real blockchain,
  real CI package builders, the real website SSL certificate).
- **Developmental** environments are deployments which violate the
  strictness of staging and production. There should be one or more such
  environments for each `area`. For example, the continuous integration
  area might have a general purpose developmental environment, and also
  a special purpose one for a special new kind of build worker.
