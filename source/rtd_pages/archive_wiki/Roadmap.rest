The One True Roadmap is the `github zcash milestone list`_. See also our blog post on the `Near Future of Zcash`_.

Priorities
==========

This is a sorted priority list:

#. Security Incident Response (fire-fighting 100% effort as necessary)
#. Continuous Improvement (consistent fraction of our team-time)
#. Payment Disclosure
#. Payment Offloading (technical name: Delegated Proving T)
#. XCAT
#. Core Circuit improvements (improve security, speed, or RAM w/out other degradations)
#. User Issued Tokens (was "User-Defined Assets / UDA")

We focus on the first item until:

- it is complete (for discrete goals),
- we've spent the allocated time/resources (for processes like maintenance),
- until an item becomes blocked, or
- we decide to cancel a goal.

Sometimes an item is blocked on prerequisite work, in which case we'll
insert the prerequisite at the appropriate position. There are some
really big prerequisites implied here. ;-)

Continuous Improvement
----------------------

Continuous improvement includes security improvements, dev support,
infrastructure improvements, paying off technical debt (refactorings,
Bitcoin PR ports).

Here "dev support" means we highly prioritize bugs or feature requests
from users of the current software, which tend to be miners, services,
wallet implementers, etcâ€¦

Non-Priorities
--------------

These aren't our priorities for direct engineering work, although we *do*
prioritize engineering support for others who do work on these things:

- end-user wallets
- mac/windows/mobile ports
