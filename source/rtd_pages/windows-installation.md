# Installing Zcashd & Zcash-cli on Windows

We do not currently support Zcashd & Zcash-cli on Windows.

We do not have documented instructions to build Zcashd & Zcash-cli, and do not recommend doing so. However, it is technically possible to run on them on Windows with a cross-compile from Debian. If you really want to do this, and require assistance, reach out to us on [community chat](https://discord.gg/PhJY6Pm).
