<p>Loads the rust library and previously used birthday for use by all other components. This is
the most common use case for the initializer--reopening a wallet that was previously created.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><a name="birthday"></a>
<code>birthday</code> - birthday height of the wallet. This value is passed to the
<a href="#">CompactBlockProcessor</a> and becomes a factor in determining the lower bounds height that this
wallet will use. This height helps with determining where to start downloading as well as how
far back to go during a rewind. Every wallet has a birthday and the initializer depends on
this value but does not own it.</p>
<p><strong>Return</strong><br/>
an instance of this class so that the function can be used fluidly. Spending keys are
not returned because the SDK does not store them and this function is for opening a wallet
that was created previously.</p>
