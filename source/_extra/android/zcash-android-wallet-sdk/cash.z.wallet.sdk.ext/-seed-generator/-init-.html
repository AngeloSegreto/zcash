<p>This is intentionally insecure. Wallet makers have told us storing keys is their specialty so we don't put a lot of
energy here. A true implementation would create a key using user interaction, perhaps with a password they know that
is never stored, along with requiring user authentication for key use (i.e. fingerprint/PIN/pattern/etc). From there,
one of these approaches might be helpful to store the key securely:</p>
